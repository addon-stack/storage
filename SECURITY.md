## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately and avoid opening public issues with exploitable details.

We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours and keep you informed as we triage and address the issue.

## Coordinated Disclosure

- We collaborate with you to verify the issue and determine the fix.
- A fix will be released as soon as feasible, depending on severity and complexity.
- After a fix is available, we will publish release notes describing the impact and mitigation.
- Please refrain from public disclosure until a fix has been released or we agree on a timeline together.
